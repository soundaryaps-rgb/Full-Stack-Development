                The Dalmatian is a breed of medium-sized dog,[2] noted for its unique white coat marked with black or liver-colored spots. Originating as a hunting dog,[3] it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia.[4][5][6] It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane.[7] Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.The Dalmatian is a medium-sized,[2] well-defined, muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina. When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58 cm) tall. Both the AKC and The Kennel Club in the UK allow height up to 24 inches (61 cm) but that is not ideal.[8] The outline of the dog should be square when viewed from the side: the body is as long from fore-chest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, the shoulders are well laid back, the stifle is well bent and the hocks are well let down. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same color as the dog's spots.
